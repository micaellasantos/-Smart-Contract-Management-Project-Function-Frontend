To execute program using Gitpod, first, logged into Gitpod and with the browser extension installed, navigate to your GitHub repository and click the  Gitpod button to open it in a new workspace. Gitpod will initialize your workspace, after which you'll be taken to the development environment. If your project is a React application, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run npm install to install dependencies and npm start to start the development server. Gitpod will provide a URL where you can access your React application. Interact with your application as you would locally, and any changes made to the code will trigger automatic hot-reloading for real-time updates.
